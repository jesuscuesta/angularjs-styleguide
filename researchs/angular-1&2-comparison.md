## AngularJS vs Angular2

| | AngularJS 1.5 | Angular 2 | Polymer |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Recommended** | | |
| | CRUD Applications | CRUD Applications | Reusability |
| | Short or tight project schedule | SEO & public visibility | Short learning curve |
| | Plenty libraries and modules | light weigh & fast loading app | Native web components |
| | AngularJS experienced team | ES6 or TypeScript | Components catalogs |
| | SPA and Rich interface Applications | Their own web components standard implementation | PRPL Pattern |
| | ES5 | Flexible to Future evolution | ES5
| | Stable framework | | Webapps
| **Not recommended** | | |
| | SPA and Rich interface App | Learning Typescript could be a problem | You must develop many features that you must have
| | SEO & Public visibility | Broad browser compatibility | SEO & Public visibility
| | ES6 or Typescript | Lack of libraries & modules | ES6 or Typescript
| | Component reutilization in other non angular projects | Component reutilization in other non angular projects | Hybrid apps
| | Flexible to Future evolution | | Broad browser compatibility |
| **Risks** |  |  |
| | Future deprecation | Immature framework | In constant change |
